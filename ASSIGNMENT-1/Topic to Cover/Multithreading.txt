7. Multithreading
Definition:
Multithreading is a programming technique where multiple threads execute concurrently to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Threads are lightweight processes that share the same memory space.

Key Concepts:

Thread: The smallest unit of execution.
Synchronization: Mechanism to control access to shared resources.
Thread Lifecycle: States include New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Timed Waiting, and Terminated.
Example:

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start(); // Starts the thread
    }
}
Usage:
Multithreading improves the performance and responsiveness of applications, especially for I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks.
