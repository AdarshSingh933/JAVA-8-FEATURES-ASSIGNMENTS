1. Lambda Functions
Definition:
Lambda functions (or lambda expressions) are a way to provide a clear and concise syntax for writing anonymous methods in Java. They are used primarily to implement functional interfaces.

Syntax:

(parameters) -> expression
or

(parameters) -> { statements }

Example:
To create a lambda function that adds two numbers:
// Functional Interface
interface Add {
    int add(int a, int b);
}

// Lambda Expression
Add addition = (a, b) -> a + b;

System.out.println(addition.add(5, 3)); // Outputs: 8
Usage:
Lambda functions are used in functional programming to make code more readable and concise, especially when working with collections and streams.
