Abstraction in Java is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It allows you to focus on what an object does instead of how it does it. Abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces in Java.

Key Points of Abstraction
Abstract Class: A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by subclasses. It can also contain non-abstract methods.

Interface: A reference type in Java that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces specify methods that a class must implement but do not provide the method implementations.

Example Implementation with Stream API and Collections
Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating abstraction using an abstract class and an interface. We'll also use streams and collections to manage and process data.

1. Define Abstract Class and Interface
java
Copy code
// Abstract class
public abstract class Shape {
    // Abstract method (does not have a body)
    public abstract double area();

    // Regular method
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

// Interface
public interface Colorable {
    void applyColor(String color);
}
2. Create Concrete Classes that Implement Abstract Class and Interface
java
Copy code
// Concrete class that extends the abstract class and implements the interface
public class Rectangle extends Shape implements Colorable {
    private double width;
    private double height;
    private String color;

    // Constructor
    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    // Implement abstract method
    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }

    // Implement interface method
    @Override
    public void applyColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    // Method to get color
    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Rectangle [width=" + width + ", height=" + height + ", color=" + color + ", area=" + area() + "]";
    }
}
3. Using Collections and Streams
Create a collection of Shape objects and use streams to process them.

java
Copy code
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a list of shapes
        List<Shape> shapes = Arrays.asList(
            new Rectangle(5, 3),
            new Rectangle(7, 2),
            new Rectangle(10, 4)
        );

        // Apply color to all shapes
        shapes.forEach(shape -> {
            if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
                ((Rectangle) shape).applyColor("Red");
            }
        });

        // Print details of all shapes
        System.out.println("All Shapes:");
        shapes.forEach(shape -> {
            System.out.println(shape);
        });

        // Use streams to filter shapes with area greater than 20
        List<Shape> largeShapes = shapes.stream()
            .filter(shape -> shape.area() > 20)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

        // Print filtered shapes
        System.out.println("\nShapes with area greater than 20:");
        largeShapes.forEach(shape -> System.out.println(shape));

        // Use streams to get shape areas as a list
        List<Double> areas = shapes.stream()
            .map(Shape::area)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

        // Print shape areas
        System.out.println("\nShape Areas:");
        areas.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
Explanation
Abstract Class Shape:

Contains an abstract method area() that must be implemented by subclasses.
Provides a regular method display() that can be used by subclasses.
Interface Colorable:

Specifies the method applyColor() that classes must implement to provide color functionality.
Concrete Class Rectangle:

Extends Shape and implements Colorable.
Provides implementations for the abstract method area() and the interface method applyColor().
Collections:

A List<Shape> is created to store Rectangle objects.
Streams:

Filtering: Use the filter method to get shapes with an area greater than 20.
Mapping: Use the map method to extract the areas of the shapes and collect them into a list.
Collecting: Use the collect method to gather results into a list.
Summary
Abstraction helps in hiding the implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts of the object.
Collections are used to manage and store multiple objects.
Streams provide a functional approach to process collections, including filtering, mapping, and collecting data.
This example demonstrates how to use abstraction in Java and how to integrate it with streams and collections for effective data management and processing.
