Inheritance in Java is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

Key Points of Inheritance
Subclass and Superclass:

Superclass: The class being inherited from.
Subclass: The class that inherits from another class.
Inheritance Types:

Single Inheritance: A class inherits from one superclass.
Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from another class, which itself inherits from another class.
Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from the same superclass.
Example Implementation with Stream API and Collections
Here's a simple example demonstrating inheritance and using streams and collections for managing and processing data.

1. Define the Superclass and Subclass
java
Copy code
// Superclass
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    // Constructor
    public Person(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    // Getters
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    // Method to display person details
    public String getDetails() {
        return "Name: " + name + ", Email: " + email;
    }
}

// Subclass
public class Student extends Person {
    private String studentId;

    // Constructor
    public Student(String name, String email, String studentId) {
        super(name, email);
        this.studentId = studentId;
    }

    // Getter
    public String getStudentId() {
        return studentId;
    }

    // Overriding method to include student details
    @Override
    public String getDetails() {
        return super.getDetails() + ", Student ID: " + studentId;
    }
}
2. Using Collections and Streams
Create a collection of Student objects and use streams to process them.

java
Copy code
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a list of students
        List<Student> students = Arrays.asList(
            new Student("Alice", "alice@example.com", "S1"),
            new Student("Bob", "bob@example.com", "S2"),
            new Student("Charlie", "charlie@example.com", "S3")
        );

        // Print all student details
        System.out.println("All Students:");
        students.forEach(student -> System.out.println(student.getDetails()));

        // Use streams to filter students with names starting with 'A'
        List<Student> filteredStudents = students.stream()
            .filter(student -> student.getName().startsWith("A"))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

        // Print filtered students
        System.out.println("\nFiltered Students (names starting with 'A'):");
        filteredStudents.forEach(student -> System.out.println(student.getDetails()));

        // Use streams to get student names as a list
        List<String> studentNames = students.stream()
            .map(Student::getName)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

        // Print student names
        System.out.println("\nStudent Names:");
        studentNames.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
Explanation
Superclass Person:

Contains common fields (name and email) and methods (getDetails()).
getDetails() provides a base implementation that can be extended or modified in subclasses.
Subclass Student:

Inherits from Person.
Adds a new field (studentId) and overrides the getDetails() method to include student-specific information.
Collections:

A List<Student> is created to store multiple Student objects.
Streams:

Filtering: Use the filter method to get students whose names start with 'A'.
Mapping: Use the map method to extract student names and collect them into a list.
Collecting: Use the collect method to gather the results into a list.
Summary
Inheritance allows for extending classes and reusing code, which is demonstrated through the Person and Student classes.
Collections are used to store and manage multiple objects.
Streams are used to process collections efficiently, including filtering, mapping, and collecting data.
This example integrates inheritance with Java Streams and Collections, showing how to manage and process data using OOP principles effectively.
