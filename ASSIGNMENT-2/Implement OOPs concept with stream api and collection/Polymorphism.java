Polymorphism in Java allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the object. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).

Key Points of Polymorphism
Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism):

Subclasses provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
The version of the method that is executed is determined at runtime based on the object's actual class.
Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism):

Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters exist in the same class.
The method to be executed is determined at compile-time based on the method signature.
Example Implementation with Stream API and Collections
Here’s a simple example demonstrating polymorphism using method overriding. We’ll use collections and streams to manage and process data.

1. Define a Base Class and Subclasses
java
Copy code
// Base class
public abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method (does not have a body)
    public abstract void makeSound();

    // Regular method
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Subclass 1
public class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof");
    }
}

// Subclass 2
public class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}
2. Using Collections and Streams
Create a collection of Animal objects and use streams to process them.

java
Copy code
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a list of animals
        List<Animal> animals = Arrays.asList(
            new Dog(),
            new Cat(),
            new Dog(),
            new Cat()
        );

        // Use streams to process animals
        System.out.println("All Animal Sounds:");
        animals.forEach(Animal::makeSound);

        // Use streams to filter animals by type (instanceof)
        List<Animal> dogs = animals.stream()
            .filter(animal -> animal instanceof Dog)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

        // Print dog sounds
        System.out.println("\nDog Sounds:");
        dogs.forEach(Animal::makeSound);

        // Use streams to count the number of each type of animal
        Map<Class<? extends Animal>, Long> animalCounts = animals.stream()
            .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(animal -> animal.getClass(), Collectors.counting()));

        // Print counts
        System.out.println("\nAnimal Counts:");
        animalCounts.forEach((type, count) -> System.out.println(type.getSimpleName() + ": " + count));
    }
}
Explanation
Base Class Animal:

Contains an abstract method makeSound() that must be implemented by subclasses.
Provides a regular method eat().
Subclasses Dog and Cat:

Each subclass provides a specific implementation of the makeSound() method.
Collections:

A List<Animal> is created to store Dog and Cat objects.
Streams:

Processing: Use the forEach method with Animal::makeSound to print sounds of all animals.
Filtering: Use the filter method to get only Dog objects.
Grouping and Counting: Use groupingBy and counting to count the number of each type of animal.
Summary
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated based on their parent class and enables method overriding and overloading.
Collections are used to manage groups of objects.
Streams provide a way to process and manipulate collections, including filtering, grouping, and counting.
